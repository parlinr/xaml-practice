UWP-022 - Hamburger Heaven

1. You will need the two images available with the code for this lesson (Food.png and Financial.png).  Add them to your Assets folder.

2. You must add two Pages to your app, Food.xaml and Financial.xaml.  Each of these pages will host a single Image control with its source set to Food.png or Financial.png, respectively.

3. You must create an app featuring hamburger style navigation using a SplitView.  It must also display a Search bar in the upper-right-hand corner, a hamburger button the upper left-hand corner, a back button next to that, and the title of the page.

4. You must create two navigation options: Financial and Food.  Each navigation option will have both an icon and text.

5. In the main / center area, you will use a Frame.  When the application starts, the Financial.xaml page will be loaded into the Frame.

6. Clicking the navigation will take you to either a page Food.xaml or Financial.xaml.

7. The back arrow button should only be displayed when you are not viewing the home (Financial) page.

8.  The search button and text box must be aligned to the right.  The button must have a search icon.  Try to figure out how to set the text in the textbox used as a placeholder.

9.  The back button must use a back arrow icon.

10. Font sizes include 24, 28, 36.

11.  Colors include LightGray.
